# mwpf-node

NodeJs adaptation of [MWPF](https://github.com/yuewuo/mwpf), for the purpose of lightweight web demonstration of decoding.

It only supports MacOS (x86/arm) and Ubuntu 22.04 and up, due to a problem of setting up the docker for cross compilation for other platforms.

Also, it's only tested on NodeJS 22 because we used `Set.symmetricDifference` function.
